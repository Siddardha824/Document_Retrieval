Ti\nmay, however, bo safely anticipated that what-\nover the decision of the judge of assize may\nbe, it will provide no security against the re-\npetition of a like catastrophe under similar\nconditions. , The only guarantee is to be found\nin the adoption of the. recommendation ap-\npended by way of \u201cvider\u201d to the verdict. It\nis tho unanimous opinion of the jury that the\ngenoral use of an automatic brake in all pas-\nsenger trains is essential for the safety of the\npassengers, and that therefore the Government\nought as soon as possible to introduce a bill\ncompelling all vailway companies to adopt this\nform of brake. \u2018This conclusion was based\nupon the evidence given at the inquest, and\nthere can hardly be a doubt that it will be\nconfirmed by the report-of the Government\ninspector, whos\u00a2 finding, as Sir Michael Hicks-\nBeach atmounced in reply to Mr. Channing,\nwill determine tho legislative action of the\nGovernment. \u2018Che witnesses examined at the\ninquest, including some of the officials now\nawaiting their trial, were agrecd that if the\nifated train had been fitted with the improved\nmechanism the tragedy might, or rather would,\nhave been prevented. There could not well\nbo a clearer or 2 more imperative case for the\nintervention of the Government. A bill of\none clause simply extending the powers of the\nBoard of Trade in the manner suggested would\nensure the requisite safeguard to the railway\npublic, and if the business of the House of\nCommons continues to make progress at the\npresent rate such a measure might be brought\n\u2018in and passed without even disjointing \u2018the\nprogramme of the Session."
