Dear Sir,\u2014You need\nnot trouble about my case. I am innocent of the\ncharge I am accused of. The police can prosecute\nthe body ; they cannot follow the soul. I am not\nafraid to meet my God. Man is the greatest enemy\nman has got. Jf the police would try to pre-\nvent crime instead of laying traps to create it,\nthere would not be one half the misery in the\nworld there is. \u00a3 s, d. is the god of all classes,\nparsons not excepted. I am hunted down for trying\nto do good. My only object, motive, or intention on\nthe 25th of June was to do the dear little children\ngood. For me to come into court with only one wit-\nness when they have four, coached and trained for\none week before they took action, and another week\nto complete it; had I the opportunity to go into the\nwitness-box (my mouth is closed) I should not have\ntaken the step [ have. Hoping you will read this to\nthe Court, and try to open the way to remove the\ngreat obstruction to justice by keeping a culprit\u2019s\nmouth closed in defence of his innocence, believe me,\nyours respectfully,\u2014J. J. Norman. N,B.\u2014IfI have\njudged anyone wrongfully I hope they will forgive me.\nMr. Moss, jun., New-cross.\u201d Mr. Kennedy said it\nwas a dreadful tragedy."
