The learned\njudge ordered him to pay a fine of \u00a350, and to enter\ninto his own recognisances of \u00a350, and to find two\nsureties of \u00a325 each, or one surety of \u00a350, for his good\nbehaviour for twelve months."

One of these was a Mr.\nGeorge Burrows, a builder, residing at Chingford, who\ngaw an advertisement asking for tenders for the\nfinishing of four small houses on the Chingford\nStation Estate. Mr. Burrows called at the address\nnamed, Langham-place, Regent-street, where he saw\nthe prisoner, who spoke to him regarding a letter which\nhe had addressed to him, The prisoner thon said that\nhe would supply plans and specifications, but would\nfirst require a deposit of two guineas, which, in the\nevent of his tender not being accepted, would be\nreturned. Mr, Burrows then banded that sum over\nto the prisoner, who gave him the plans and epecifi-\ncations. Mr. Burrows, making sure that he would\nhave the completion of the job, went down to look at\nthe carcases of the houses, when he found that the\nplans were extremely faulty and erroneus, thero\nbeing now bow windows in them, and it was evident\nthat they had not been prepared from a view of the\nhouses. The prosecutor compleined of this, but could\nnot get one penny of his money back. The other\ncasos were of a sitmilar character. The jury, without\nretiring, returned a verdict of guilty. Detective-\nsergeant Gethen said he knew of twenty-five cases\nsimilar to those upon which the prisoner had been\ntriod ; and, Sessions Warder Humphreys having proved\na previous conviction on August 12th, 1878, the learned\njudge sentenced the prisoner to five years penal ser-\nvitude, ;"
