The prosecutors in this\ncase were Messrs. Brinsmead and Co., pianoforte\nmanufacturers and timber merchants. The company\nof which the defendant was the managing director\nwas formed for the purpose of carrying on the business\nof timber merchants and packing-case makers. At\nthe close of last year they had entered into extensive\ncontracts with the Government for the supply of pack-\ning cases and ammunition boxes to the War Office.\nMessrs.

It appeared,\nhowever, that the contracts entered into by the\ncompany with the Government were really valuable\ncontracts, under which the defendant\u2019s company\nwould have derived considerable profit, and that but\nfor the winding-up of the company. by an adverse\nereditor, the supply of cases at the War Office would\nhave continued to go on, and the prosecutors would,\nin all probability, have received full payment. It\nalso appeared that everything that was done by the\ndefendant in the matter was done in his capacity of\nmanaging director on behalf of the company. It\nwas also elicited in favour of the defendant that\nat the time of the winding-up goods of the value\nof \u00a3500 were ready for delivery by the company to\nthe War Office. Witnesses were called for the\ndefence, whose evidence went to show that the com-\npany was using every exertion to carry out the con-\ntracts, and that no frand was contemplated. The\njury found the defendant guilty, but not with intent\nto defraud, and strongly recommended him to mercy.\nMr. Gill reminded the court that the defendent had\nlost everything he possessed, or he would, by his\nconnection with this company, and he never intended\nto commit any fraud. The recorder allowed the\ndefendant to be discharged upon his entering into\na recognisance to appear and receive judgment if\ncalled upon."
