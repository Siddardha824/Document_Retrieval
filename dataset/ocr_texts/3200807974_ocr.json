The\ncourt was crowded with persons interested in the\ncase, Mr. Superintendent Shepherd watched the pro-\nceedings on behalf of the police authorities, Inspector\nDoogan conducting the case. The prisoners were\nranged in two lines across the court. Half a dozen of\nthem were inthe uniform of the Salvation Army. The\nothers presented the appearance of respectable work-\ning men, Mr. Salfford (chief clerk) said he had a\nletter from a Colonel Nicol, at the headquarters of the\nArmy, asking that the prisoners might be remanded\ntill counsel could be instructed for the defence,\nCaptain Reynolds: I have to ask for a remand,\nsir. We have had no time to get legal\nadvice. Mr. Sheil: Why have they not sent some\none from your headquarters? Captain Reynolds:\nThey have not had time, sir. We all had to be here\nat ten o\u2019clock this morning. Mr. Safford; The pri-\nsoners were admitted to bail between four and five\no\u2019clock on Sunday afternoon. Mr. Sheil: What time\ndo you ask for? Mr. Parsons (an officer from the\nSalvation Army headquarters): I appear on behalf\nof Messrs, Burton, Matthews, and Ranger, solicitors\nto the Salvation Army, to ask for a remand for three\nor four days for the purpose of instructing counsel.\nMr. Sheil: I shall do nothing of the sort; it is a\nridiculous request. I will remand them until to-\nmorrow, if you like. Mr. Parsons; Make it two\ndays, your worship. Inspector Doogan: There are\nseveral gentlemen here as witnesses for the police who\ncannot very well come on another day. Mr. Sheil:\nVery well, I will go on with the case now. They have\nhad plenty of time to obtainadvice. Mr. Parsons still\npressed for a remand, Mr, Sheil: Very well; I will\nremand them, on the same bailas before. A Police\nWitness: But, your worship, I have already been\nkept here since eleven o\u2019clock this morning. Mr.\nSheil: I can\u2019t help it. If I do not give them time to\nget counsel it will be a great grievance. I will\nremand the prisoners to any day that will suit the\nwitnesses. Mr. Superintendent Shepherd: The\nwhole of the prisoners have been on bail since Sunday\nafternoon, Mr. Sheil: I will go on with the case.\nAfter a moment\u2019s consideration Mr. Sheil added :\nNo; I think, on consideration of the circumstances,\nthat I will adjourn the case tilla later date. The\nprisoners must be ready with their defence then. A\nWitness ; Your honour, there are over a dozen gen-\ntlemen here to-day who perhaps cannot attend\nagain, Mr. Sheil: I can\u2019t help it. I cannot go on\nif they ask for legal assistance. Mr. Superintendent\nShepherd agreeing, the further hearing of the case was\nadjourned. A gentleman put in bail at once for all\nthe prisoners\u2019 reappearance."
