The\nscout\u2019s business was to get men to\ntake new jobs. When there was a\nbig construction operation or a\nshortage of men for some special\nwork and lately to furnish hands\nfor the big works engaged in. mu-\nnitions the scout was in demand.\nHe always managed to get the men,\neven if he did not make them stick\nand sometimes the men went after\nhim with-clubs. According to a man\nwho has given much attention to the\nproblems attending mobilization of\nlabor the tactful manner in which\nDirector Lightner, of the State Em-\nployment Bureau, took up the mat-\nter with the big employers and the\nconfidence the heads of big works\nhad in Edgar C, Felton, who devised\nthe plan adopted by the Committee\nof Public Safety, brought this about,\nWhen the big shipbuilding opera-\ntions began there were signs that\nthe scramble for men which mark-\ned the munitions boom of a few\nyears ago would be repeated and\nthe scout who robbed railroads,\ncontractors and small mill owners\nto get gangs for the big works only\nto have some other big works\u2019 scout\ncome along and take most of them\naway was in his heydey. But it did\nnot take the heads of the big es-\ntablishments long to see that they\nwere in danger of being worked and\nthey sent their chief scouts to the\nstate agencies. The\u2019 shipbuilding\npeople did the same thing. And\nnow when a man shows up at a\nstate office who is fitted a place is\nfound for him where he is most\nneeded and when the shipbuilding\ngets to a point where men qualified\nin certain lines the \u2018Public Safety\nauthorities are able to call on half\na dozen big works for the men and\nthey are sent. Each establishment's\nhead knows that Mr. Felton*is draw-\ning on his rivals, too, and the re-\nsult is that men are drafted and\nthings go on without disturbance.\nIn other words, the labor problem\nas far as mechanics and unskilled\nlabor are concerned is being work-\ned out and probably the farm labor\nsituation may yet be solved,\n* ad"
