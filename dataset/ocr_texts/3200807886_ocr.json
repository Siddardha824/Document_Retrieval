The boys were found in the\nbuilding at ten o'clock on the previous Saturday\nmorning. They had evidently made the place their\nhome. The elder boy was armed with a catapult,\nand in his possession were a number of lead pellets.\nThe extensive building had been almost stripped of\nits piping, and there were evidences that the lead so\nobtained had been melted down to make pellets\nfor the catapults, which were used to shoot the\nnumerous birds nested in the roof of the building,\nwhich were afterwards cooked and eaten, On the\nhouse where Arnold resided being searched a chisel\nfashioned like a burglu\u2019s \u201cjemmy\u201d was found,\ntogether with a silver-plated teapot and cream jug,\nand several plated spoons, which it was ascertained\nhad been stolen froma house in Percy-terrace, Mande-\nville-street, Clapton, The owner was not present,\nand Constable 208 J said there was no further\nevidence to connect the prisoners with the robbery\nat that house.

The solicitor added that\ngreat danger might arise to adjoining property by\nthe boys kindling fires on the floor. The boys seemed\nto have been neglected by their parents, one mother\nadmitting that she had taken a situation.as a house-\nkeeper and left the boy to shift for himself.
