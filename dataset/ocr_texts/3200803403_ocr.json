He walked by her aide for a second or\ntwo, and then suddenly fired o pistol at the back of\nher head, Sheecreamed, \u2018\u2018 Murder; Lam shot !\u201d and\nfell to the ground insensible, A\u2019girl living on the spot\nran across the road and recognised Mrs, Tomlinson as\nshe lay bleeding on the pavement. Boing Saturday\nnight there were many people about. A crowd soon\naseembled, and the injured woman having been car-\nried into her own house, Dr, Duncan, of Amherst\nPark, was sent for, He scon arrived, and found\nher suffering from a bullet wound behind the right\near, but the bullet had not penetrated the skull,\nhaving bounded off after striking the bone, Search\nwaa subsequently made for the bullet, but it\ncould not be found. After the woman fell Esworthy\nhurried to the opposite side of the street, and threw\nsomething over a fence, He had been seen to fire\nthe pistol by some passers by, and was seized by\nseveral men, who took him towarda the Stoke\nNewington Police-station. They wore met, however,\nby Sergeant Collina, of the N Division, to whom\nthey reported the circumatances of the case, and gave\nthe man into his custody. Collins, accompanied by\na great many persons, conveyed Hsworthy to the\nTottenham Police-station, Thera he waa charged\nwith \u201cshooting and wounding with intent to murder\none Harriet Tomlinson, at the High-road, Stamford\nHill, in the parish of Tottenham.\u201d He gave the name\nof William Esworthy, aged twenty-eight, address 29,\nSouth-street, Mancheater-aquare ; business, commis.\nsion agent. On the charge being yead over to him\nhe remarked, \u2018(She did it herself, and I took the\nrevolver away from her, and threw it over a fence\non the opposite side of the road,\u201d On being searched\na few coing and a cleaning-rod of a pistol was found\nupon him, but no ammunition, The prisoner having\nbeen locked up, Inspector Ashwell and Sergeant\nColling proceeded to the spot indicated by him to\nsearch for the revolver; but, after @ close inspec-\ntion for an hour or 80, they had not succeeded in\nfinding it, The search then discontinued ; it was re-\nsumed on Sunday morning at daylight by Sergeant\nCollins, and at a quarter-past five o'clock he dis-\ncovered the revolver in a builder's yard, almost\nopposite where the crime was committed, It is a\nweapon with seven chambers, six of which were\nloaded when it was picked up, Ib was, therefore,\nfully charged when the attack waa made upon Mrs.\nTomlinson,"

On Sunday evening the symp-\ntoms ware highly favourable to that view. As may\nbe imagined, the affair, happening in a crowded\nthoroughfare at a busy time on Satarday night,\ncreated intense excitement. Prisoner will be taken\nbefore the magistrates ab Edmonton in a day or two."
