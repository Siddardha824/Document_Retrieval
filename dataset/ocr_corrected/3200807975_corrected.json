Dear Sir, -ou need not trouble about my case. I am innocent of the charge I am accused of. The police can prosecute the body ; they cannot follow the soul. I am not afraid to meet my God. Man is the greatest enemy man has got. J@ the police would try to pre- vent crime instead of laying traps to create it, there would not be one half the misery in the world there is. @@@, d. is the god of all classes  parsons not excepted. I am hunted down for trying to do good. My only obeect, motive, or intention on the 25th of June was to do the dear little children good. For me to come into court with only one wit\u2010 ness when they have four, coached and trained"
